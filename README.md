# Soccer Coach Portfolio Website

A professional website for Javier Mart√≠nez, a soccer coach based in Barcelona, Spain. This project was developed using React and Tailwind CSS to create a modern, responsive web application that showcases advanced front-end development skills.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website was designed and developed as part of my front-end development portfolio to demonstrate my proficiency in React.js and Tailwind CSS. The project features multiple interactive components, complex state management, and responsive design.

### Development Process

I built this project completely from scratch, starting with a Vite-powered React application. Each component was carefully planned and implemented to showcase different front-end techniques. The development process included:

1. Setting up a React application with Vite
2. Configuring Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Creating the basic application structure and routing
4. Developing reusable UI components
5. Implementing complex interactive features
6. Ensuring responsive design across all screen sizes
7. Debugging and fixing errors in JSX structure and component logic

## Features Implemented

The website includes several advanced features that demonstrate my React and Tailwind CSS skills:

### 1. Dynamic Training Program Builder
- Multi-step form with progress tracking
- Conditional rendering based on user inputs
- Form validation and state management
- Interactive UI elements for user selections

### 2. Interactive Tactical Board
- Drag-and-drop player positioning
- Formation switching
- Play pattern animations
- Interactive field elements

### 3. Skill Assessment Dashboard
- Data visualization with charts
- Progress tracking metrics
- Goal setting and monitoring
- Performance comparison tools

### 4. Parallax Scrolling Hero Section
- Multi-layered parallax effect
- Responsive design across devices
- Custom animations and transitions

### 5. Responsive Navigation
- Mobile-friendly collapsible menu
- Smooth transitions between pages
- Active link highlighting

### 6. Success Stories Showcase
- Case studies with metrics
- Before/after comparisons
- Interactive testimonial cards

## Pages

The website contains the following pages:

1. **Home** - Features a parallax hero section, introduction, and featured programs
2. **About** - Details the coach's background, philosophy, and certifications
3. **Training Programs** - Showcases the dynamic program builder and available programs
4. **Success Stories** - Displays client testimonials and success cases
5. **Contact** - Offers a contact form and location information
6. **Tactical Board** - Provides an interactive tool for creating formations
7. **Dashboard** - Displays progress tracking and performance metrics

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** - Component-based UI development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **React Context API** - State management
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **React Intersection Observer** - Scroll-based animations

## Challenges Overcome

During development, I encountered and solved several challenges:

1. Configuring Tailwind CSS with Vite required understanding the proper setup for PostCSS
2. Creating drag-and-drop functionality for the tactical board required careful state management
3. Building the multi-step form with validation in the program builder needed thoughtful component design
4. Implementing responsive designs that work across all device sizes demanded attention to detail
5. Fixing JSX syntax errors in complex nested components required systematic debugging

## Future Enhancements

Future plans for the website include:

- Adding authentication for client login
- Implementing a booking system for scheduling sessions
- Creating an e-commerce section for training products
- Adding internationalization for Spanish and Catalan languages
- Implementing video analysis tools for player feedback

## Credits

This project was independently developed by me as part of my portfolio. All code was written by hand to demonstrate my React and Tailwind CSS skills. 

The design and feature ideas were inspired by professional coaching websites but implemented with my own approach to UI/UX and component architecture.
